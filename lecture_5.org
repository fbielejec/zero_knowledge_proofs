Alice (the prover) knows a and b such that their sum is 12. 
To prove it she sends corresponding points on EC $aG$, $bG$ to Bob (the verifier) s.t. 

[a]G + [b]G = [a+b]G

Bob verifies that [a]G + [b]G = [12]G

- [ ] This can be generalized to a set of equations
- [ ] We can only do this for addition (not multiplication - point multiplication is not defined for EC points)
  - fully homomorphic encryption
  - pairings
** IN-PROGRESS Elliptic Curve operations in Solidity
- uses bn128 curve
- eccAdd(address 6)
- eccMul(address 7)
- eccPairing(address 8)
