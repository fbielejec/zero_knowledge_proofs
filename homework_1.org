For all problems below, assume the finite field is p = 71.

** DONE Problem 1

*NOTES*

- congruent = compatible, similar

=Definition: congruence=

Two integers $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ are *congruent* modulo some $p \geq 1$ if there is an integer $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that:

$a=k \cdot p + b$

We then write the *congruence relation* as:

$a \equiv b \quad \text{ mod } m$

where:
- $m$ is called the *modulus*

Congruence relation is compatible with the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication

Find the elements in a finite field that are congruent to the following values:
- $-1$
- $-4$
- $-160$
- $500$

for field_element in range(0,p+1):
  for z in [-1,-4,-160,500]:
    if z % p == field_element: congruent.setdefault(field_element, []).append(z)

print(f"{congruent}");
