For all problems below, assume the finite field is p = 71.

** DONE Problem 1

*NOTES*

- congruent = compatible, similar

=Definition: congruence=

Two integers $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ are *congruent* modulo some $p \geq 1$ if there is an integer $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that:

$a=k \cdot p + b$

We then write the *congruence relation* as:

$a \equiv b \quad \text{ mod } m$

where:
- $m$ is called the *modulus*

Congruence relation is compatible with the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication

Find the elements in a finite field that are congruent to the following values:
- $-1$
- $-4$
- $-160$
- $500$

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session zk :kernel zero_knowledge :async yes :exports both
p = 71
congruent = {}

for field_element in range(0,p+1):
  for z in [-1,-4,-160,500]:
    if z % p == field_element: congruent.setdefault(field_element, []).append(z)

print(f"{congruent}");
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: {3: [500], 53: [-160], 67: [-4], 70: [-1]}

** DONE Problem 2
Find the elements that are congruent to a = 5/6, b = 11/12, and c = 21/12
Verify your answer by checking that a + b = c (in the finite field)

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session zk :kernel zero_knowledge :async yes :exports both
p = 71

def field_div(a, b, p):
  '''a * b^{-1} mod p'''
  return (a * pow(b, -1, p)) % p

a=field_div(5,6,p)
b=field_div(11,12,p)
c=field_div(21,12,p)

(a+b) % p == c
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: True

** DONE Problem 3
Find the elements that are congruent to a = 2/3, b = 1/2, and c = 1/3.

Verify your answer by checking that a * b = c (in the finite field)

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session zk :kernel zero_knowledge :async yes :exports both
p = 71

def field_div(a, b, p):
  '''a * b^{-1} mod p'''
  return (a * pow(b, -1, p)) % p

a=field_div(2,3,p)
b=field_div(1,2,p)
c=field_div(1,3,p)

(a*b) % p == c
