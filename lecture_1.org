* IN-PROGRESS Finite Fields
- Informally a *Field* is a set on which common arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication)  behave "nicely", e.g. as we wopuld expect them to behave on the real numbers, e.g.:
  - add/multiply two numbers in a set and you get a number that is also in a set
  - for addition operation there is a number that acts trivially ($a+0=a$)
  - for multiplication operation there is a number that acts trivially ($1*a=a$)
  - division by 0 is exludded
  - every element has an inverse (for addition this is $-a$, for multiplication $1/a=a^{-1}$
  - ...
- For a more formal definition see: [[file:pre_course.org::*Field][Field]].
- *Finite Field* is a Field with finitely many elements (countable finite).
- For a formal definition see: [[file:pre_course.org::*Finite field (Galois Field)][Finite field (Galois Field)]]
* DONE Addition and subtraction, additive inverses in a Finite Field
Let's assume $GF(7)= \{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}$

Addition in the field: addition modulo p

#+BEGIN_SRC sage :session . :exports both
p=7
F = GF(p)

print(f"F(3) + F(6) = {F(3)+F(6)}")
print(f"(3 + 6) mod {p} = {(3+6) % p}", )
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: F(3) + F(6) = 2
: (3 + 6) mod 7 = 2

Subtraction is the addition of an *additive inverse*:

$\forall a,b \in F_{p} \quad a - b = a + (-b)$

where:
- $p$ is the field characteristic

In $F_{p}$ *Additive inverse* of $b$ is the element that when added to $b$ yields additive neutral element (that is 0):

$\forall b \in F_{p} \quad b + (-b) = (-b) + b = 0$

In a finite field of characteristic $$p the additive inverse of $b \in F_{p}$ is:

$-b = p-b$

#+BEGIN_SRC sage :session . :exports both
p = 7
F = GF(p)

additive_inverse = {}
for x in F:
  additive_inverse[x]=-x

print(f"GF({7}) elements and their additive inverse elements: {additive_inverse}")

for elem, inv in additive_inverse.items():
  print(f"{elem} + {inv} = {elem + inv}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

* DONE Multiplicative inverses in a Finite Field

---

*NOTE*

In the context of a Finite Field $F_{p}$ when we are talking about the *multiplicative group* $(F, \times)$ we are excluding the $0$, as it does not have an *inverse* (as similar to real numbers, division by $0$ is undefined so we cannot have $0^{-1} = 1/0$).

=Definition: multiplicative inverse=

Multiplicative inverse of $a \in F_{p}$ is an element $a^{-1} \in F_{p}$ s.t.:

$a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = 1$

=Theorem: Fermat's Little Theorem=

If $p$ is a prime number then for any $a \in \mathbb{Z}$:

$a^p \equiv a \quad \text{mod } p$

If a is not an integer multiple of $p$ (which is clearly the case in a finite field, as for every $a \in F_{p} \quad gcd(a,p) = 1$) Fermat's Little Theorem is equivalent to:

$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \quad \text{mod } p$

which we can write as:

$a \cdot a^{p-2} \equiv 1 \quad \text{mod } p$

Meaning that $a^{p-2}$ is the *multiplicative inverse* of $a$ in $F_{p}$.
