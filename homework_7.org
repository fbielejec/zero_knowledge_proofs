** DONE Create an arithmetic circuit that takes signals $x_1,x_2\ldots,x_n$ and is satisfied if at least one signal is 0.
$(x_1 -1) \cdot (x_2 -1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (x_n-1) \equiv 0$
** DONE Create an arithmetic circuit that takes signals  $x_1,x_2\ldots,x_n$ and is satsified if all signals are 1.

$x_1  \cdot x_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot x_n \equiv 1$

** DONE A bipartite graph is a graph that can be colored with two colors such that no two neighboring nodes share the same color. Devise an arithmetic circuit scheme to show you have a valid witness of a 2-coloring of a graph. 

Let $n$ be the number of nodes, let's assign blue = 1, red = 2.

Every node $x_1,x_2,\ldots x_n$ can be either red or blue:

$\forall i \leq n : \quad (x_i-1) \cdot (x_i-2) \equiv 0$

No two neighbouring nodes can have the same colour:

| node_i | node_j | product |
|      1 |      1 |       1 |
|      2 |      1 |       2 |
|      1 |      2 |       2 |
|      2 |      2 |       4 |

From the table above we can see that the only acceptable product of two neighbouring nodes is 2:

$\forall i,j \leq n, i \neq j: \quad  (x_i\cdot x_j -2) \equiv 0$

Alternatively we can model this constraint as:

$\forall i,j \leq n, i \neq j: \quad  (x_i - x_j)^2 \neq 0$
