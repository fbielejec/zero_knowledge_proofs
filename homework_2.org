*NOTES*

=Binary Operator=

Let $A$ be a set. A *binary operator* $*$ maps every possible pair of elements from A to another element in $A$:

$* : A \times A \rightarrow A$

where:

- $A \times A$ is the *cartesian product* of $A$ with itself, i.e. the set of *ordered pairs* $(a,b) = \{ a \in A, b \in A \}$ (2-tuples as they are often called in CS).
- ordered pairs can be defined as sets of sets, e.g. $(a,b) = \{a, \{ b \} \}$, $(b,a) = \{ \{ a \}, b \}$.

Binary operator $*$ is *closed* on the set $A$ if applying it to any ordered pair from $A \times A$ always results in an element from $A$.

We need a function that takes two elements from \mathbb{R} as input, but in some cases can take us to a set different that $\mathbb{R}$. Reals number are a subset of the set of complex numbers $\mathb{C}$, therefore for example:

$f: \mathbb{R} \times  \mathbb{R} \text{ s.t} \quad f(a,b) = \sqrt{a+b}$

$f$ is a function because it:
- takes as an input every ordered pair from $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$
- for every ordered pair (a,b) there is

For example for $f(2,-3)=\sqrt{-1}=i \in \mathbb{C}$
* DONE Find a binary operator that is closed but not associative for real numbers

---

*NOTE*

=Definition: associativity=

Let A be a set and $*$ a binary operator s.t:

$*: A \times A \rightarrow A$

We would say that $*$ is *associative* if $\forall a,b,c \in A$

$*(*(a,b),c) = *(a,*(b,c))$

---

Let's take $f: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ s.t.

$f(a,b) = a^b$

Such an operator is closed, it will never result in a number that is not real (when applied to a pair of reals)
It is not associative because generally:

$(a^{b})^{c} = a^{b\cdot c} \quad \neq \quad a^{(b^{c})}= a^{b^{c}}$

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session zk :async yes
a=2;b=3;c=4

def f(a,b):
  return pow(a,b)

f(f(a,b),c) == f(a,f(b,c))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: False

- Ring ⊃ Field

- *closed*: adding two even integers results in an even integer.
- *associative*: yes, by the fact that addition is associative.
- *identity element*: yes, $0$ is the natural candidate for an identity under addition, and $0$ fullfills the definition of an even number ($0 \equiv 0 \text{ mod } 2$).
- *existence of inverse elements*: yes, negation is the inverse of every element under addition.
- *commutativity*: yes, by the fact that addition operator is commutative.

Therefore it is an *abelian group*.

* DONE What algebraic structure is all odd integers under multiplication?

- *closed*: yes, multiplying two odd integers results in an odd integer (GCD of two odd integers is an odd integer).
- *associative*: yes, multiplication is associative.
- *identity*:, yes, $1$ is the identity element
- *inverses*: no, inverses are of form $1/a$ (rational)

This is a *monoid*.

* DONE Let our set be 3 x 2 matrices of integers under addition. What algebraic structure is this?

- *identity*: matrix $E=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0  \\ 0 & 0  \\0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ is the identity element.
- *existence of inverse elements*: For every $M=\begin{bmatrix} m_{11} & m_{12}  \\ m_{21} & m_{22}  \\ m_{31} & m_{32} \end{bmatrix}$, $-M=\begin{bmatrix} -m_{11} & -m_{12}  \\ -m_{21} & -m_{22}  \\ -m_{31} & -m_{32} \end{bmatrix}$ is it's inverse.
