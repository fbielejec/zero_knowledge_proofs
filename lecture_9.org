* Notes
- lagrange interpolation
 - is there a homomorphism up to the x points you choose for the interpolation of a vector?
- vector adition and polynomial addition are homomorphic, up to the Lagrange interpolation
 - what follows is that vector by scalar multiplication is also homomorphic to polynomial by constant multiplication.
- schwartz-zippel lemma
