* Notes
- lagrange interpolation
- vector adition and polynomial addition are homomorphic, up to the Lagrange interpolation
 - what follows is that vector by scalar multiplication is also homomorphic to the Lagrange polynomial by scalar multiplication.
- schwartz-zippel lemma
- QAP: $Lv \odot Rv \equiv Ov$
